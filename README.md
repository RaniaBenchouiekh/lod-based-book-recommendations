# Solid Google Books
**Solid Google Books**, a decentralized plateform for book recommendations.

## Motivation
The decentralized plateform **Solid Google Books** (SGB) was created in order to provide book recommendations to the users. 

It uses a new technology called [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) which is an exciting new project led by Prof. Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, taking place at MIT. The project aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy. 

The **SGB** plateform was based on the Solid technology to give the user the choice of which data or how much data he would like to share with the application, and also to offer him a safe storage space called [POD](https://solid.community/), where he can store his personal information and control it.

## API / Datasets references

For this project, we used a well known and a simple API which is the [GoogleBooks API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) (since it's free, it requires a new API key after a certain number of uses), in addition to the [DBpedia Dataset](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/).

## Features

**Solid Google Books** offers mainly the following functionnalities : 

- Profile management (add, delete or modify profile information).
- The possibility to save favorite books in the Solid POD.
- The possibility to rate favorite books in the Solid POD.
- The possibility to search for specific books by introducing a keyword.
- Offering recommendations that suits the user's preferences and profile.
- Including a **Recommender Systems Marketplace** to choose a recommender system provider.

## Application usage
